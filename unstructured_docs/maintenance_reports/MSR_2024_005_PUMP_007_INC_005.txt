MAINTENANCE SERVICE REPORT
===========================
Report ID: MSR-2024-005
Pump ID: PUMP_007
Incident ID: INC_005
Service Date: 2024-03-02
Technician: Lisa Rodriguez
Service Type: Performance Investigation

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Flow degradation reported on PUMP_007 (HydroMax-5000). Medium patient impact classification. 
Systematic investigation conducted to identify and resolve performance issues.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
- Flow rate reduced to 43.8 L/s (normal range: 48-55 L/s, ~12% degradation)
- Fault Code FC_003: Low Flow Rate Warning
- Pressure readings normal: 116.5 PSI
- Vibration elevated but below alarm threshold: 4.0 mm/s
- Power consumption normal
- No fault codes for mechanical components

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Detailed investigation revealed impeller cavitation due to suction-side conditions:
1. Partial blockage in suction piping (debris accumulation)
2. Impeller blade surface roughness from extended operation (1,023 days)
3. Vortex formation at inlet during peak demand periods
4. Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH) marginally below required value

Analysis indicates combined hydraulic efficiency loss rather than single component failure.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Coordinated shutdown during low-demand period
2. Suction piping inspection and cleaning (removed debris accumulation)
3. Impeller removal and surface reconditioning
4. Blade leading edge polishing to restore surface finish
5. Suction piping alignment verification
6. Anti-vortex plate installation at inlet
7. Performance curve testing and verification

PARTS REPLACED:
- Anti-vortex inlet plate (Part #: HM5000-AVP-001)
- Suction line strainer element (Part #: HM5000-STR-100)

REFURBISHMENT WORK:
- Impeller surface polishing (in-house work)
- Blade leading edge restoration

POST-SERVICE VERIFICATION:
- Flow rate restored: 46.8 L/s at rated head (EXCELLENT)
- Efficiency improved from 78% to 84%
- Vibration reduced: 2.9 mm/s (NORMAL)
- NPSH margin increased: 2.1m above required
- Cavitation noise eliminated
- Pressure stability: ±0.3 PSI variation (EXCELLENT)

HYDRAULIC PERFORMANCE TEST RESULTS:
Shutoff Head: 142.5 PSI (spec: 140 PSI) ✓
Rated Flow @ Rated Head: 46.8 L/s (spec: 45-50 L/s) ✓
Best Efficiency Point: 48.2 L/s @ 84.2% efficiency ✓
Maximum Flow: 58.1 L/s (spec: 55-60 L/s) ✓

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Install permanent NPSH monitoring on all HydroMax-5000 units
- Implement suction strainer inspection every 90 days
- Consider suction piping redesign to improve hydraulic conditions
- Schedule impeller reconditioning every 900 days for cavitation-prone locations
- Add flow rate trending to predictive maintenance dashboard
- Perform periodic performance curve testing to track degradation

Total Service Time: 4.5 hours
Next Scheduled Maintenance: 2024-06-02
Warranty Status: UNDER WARRANTY (Expires 2025-02-28)
