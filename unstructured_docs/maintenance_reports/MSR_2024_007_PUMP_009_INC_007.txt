MAINTENANCE SERVICE REPORT
===========================
Report ID: MSR-2024-007
Pump ID: PUMP_009
Incident ID: INC_007
Service Date: 2024-03-28
Technician: Sarah Chen
Service Type: Critical Emergency Repair

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Catastrophic bearing failure in PUMP_009 (HydroMax-5000) at coordinates 40.7306,-73.9352.
Critical patient impact - immediate response required. Unit experienced complete operational failure.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
- Severe vibration spike (RMS reading: 6.6 mm/s) 
- Complete bearing seizure detected
- Motor current draw exceeded 150% of nominal rating
- Flow rate collapsed to 31.8 L/s (critical threshold: 35 L/s)
- Multiple fault codes triggered: FC_005, FC_001, FC_013
- Emergency stop system activated automatically

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Catastrophic failure due to cumulative bearing degradation over 1,567 service days - well beyond 
recommended replacement interval. Previous seal leak (INC_002) may have introduced contaminants 
into bearing housing. Lubrication analysis revealed metal particles and water contamination.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Emergency isolation at 03:47 - backup system activated
2. Complete bearing housing replacement
3. Motor shaft inspection and polishing
4. Seal assembly replacement (preventive)
5. Lubrication system complete overhaul
6. Vibration monitoring system upgrade
7. 8-hour burn-in test with continuous monitoring

PARTS REPLACED:
- Complete bearing housing assembly (Part #: HM5000-BRG-HOUSING)
- Main bearing set (Part #: HM5000-BRG-001)
- Motor shaft seal (Part #: HM5000-SEAL-002)
- Lubrication pump (Part #: HM5000-LUB-PUMP)
- Vibration sensor upgrade (Part #: VIB-SENS-SMART-001)

POST-SERVICE VERIFICATION:
- Vibration RMS: 1.9 mm/s (EXCELLENT)
- Flow rate: 50.2 L/s (OPTIMAL)
- Bearing temperature: 48°C (EXCELLENT)
- Motor current: 98% nominal (NORMAL)
- All diagnostic tests passed

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- URGENT: Schedule immediate inspection of all HydroMax-5000 units with >1,400 service days
- Implement mandatory bearing replacement at 1,000 service days
- Install predictive vibration monitoring on all critical pumps
- Consider unit retirement at 1,800 service days
- Quarterly oil analysis for all high-service-age units

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE:
- FDA Medical Device Reporting (MDR) filed: MDR-2024-0328-001
- Hospital safety committee notified
- Incident report submitted to facility management

Total Service Time: 11.5 hours
Next Scheduled Maintenance: 2024-04-28
Warranty Status: OUT OF WARRANTY (Expired 2024-08-20)
