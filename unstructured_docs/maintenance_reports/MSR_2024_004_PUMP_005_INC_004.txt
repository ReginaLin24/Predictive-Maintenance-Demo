MAINTENANCE SERVICE REPORT
===========================
Report ID: MSR-2024-004
Pump ID: PUMP_005
Incident ID: INC_004
Service Date: 2024-02-18
Technician: David Park
Service Type: Emergency Repair

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Critical motor overheat condition detected on PUMP_005 (HydroMax-5000). High patient impact 
classification requiring immediate response. Unit automatically shut down by protection system.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
- Motor winding temperature reached 142°C (limit: 130°C)
- Motor current draw elevated by 18% above nominal
- Fault Code FC_002: Motor Temperature Exceeds Threshold
- Thermal imaging revealed hot spots in phase B winding
- Insulation resistance test showed degradation: 2.1 MΩ (minimum: 2.0 MΩ)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Multi-factor failure mode identified:
1. Primary: Cooling fan motor bearing failure reducing airflow by 60%
2. Secondary: Accumulated dust/debris on motor cooling fins
3. Contributing: Ambient temperature 8°C above seasonal average
4. Extended service age (1,389 days) with limited cooling system maintenance

Motor windings showed early signs of thermal stress but no permanent damage detected.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Emergency shutdown confirmed (auto-protection activation)
2. Complete motor cooling system overhaul
3. Cooling fan motor replacement
4. Motor housing and cooling fin cleaning
5. Insulation resistance testing (all phases)
6. Thermal cycling test performed
7. 4-hour operational test under full load

PARTS REPLACED:
- Cooling fan motor assembly (Part #: HM5000-FAN-MTR-001)
- Fan motor bearings (Part #: BRG-6204-2RS)
- Thermal protection relay (Part #: TPR-150-MOT)
- Motor cooling fins (cleaned, not replaced)

POST-SERVICE VERIFICATION:
- Motor temperature under full load: 78°C (EXCELLENT)
- Current draw: nominal +2% (NORMAL)
- Insulation resistance: 15.3 MΩ (EXCELLENT)
- Cooling airflow: 850 CFM (specification: 800 CFM)
- Vibration levels: 2.8 mm/s (NORMAL)
- Thermal imaging: uniform temperature distribution

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement quarterly cooling system inspection protocol
- Install ambient temperature monitoring for all motor installations
- Consider environmental enclosure upgrade for high-temperature locations
- Motor insulation resistance testing every 6 months
- Cooling fan motor preventive replacement at 800 operating days
- Add motor current monitoring to predictive maintenance algorithm

Total Service Time: 5.5 hours
Next Scheduled Maintenance: 2024-05-18
Warranty Status: OUT OF WARRANTY (Expired 2024-11-10)

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE:
- Service meets NFPA 70E electrical safety standards
- Motor testing per IEEE 43-2013 (insulation resistance)
- Work performed by licensed electrician #E-2024-4892
