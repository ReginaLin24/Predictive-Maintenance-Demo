MAINTENANCE SERVICE REPORT
===========================
Report ID: MSR-2024-012
Pump ID: PUMP_004
Incident ID: INC_020
Service Date: 2024-09-18
Technician: Michael O'Brien
Service Type: Motor Overheat - Preventive Intervention

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Motor temperature alarm triggered on PUMP_004 (AquaFlow-3000) at coordinates 40.7614,-73.9776.
Medium patient impact - early intervention prevented escalation to critical failure. Proactive 
response based on temperature trending and previous incident analysis (INC_009).

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
- Motor temperature reached 98°C (alarm threshold: 95°C, critical: 125°C)
- Temperature trending showed 2°C increase per week over last 4 weeks
- Motor current draw: 102% of nominal (slightly elevated)
- Cooling fan performance degraded (airflow 20% below specification)
- Dust accumulation on motor housing and ventilation ports
- Fault Code FC_002 triggered: Motor Temperature Exceeds Threshold
- Service age: 678 days (mid-life for this model)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Motor overheat caused by inadequate cooling due to: (1) cooling fan bearing wear reducing 
airflow by 20%, (2) dust and debris accumulation on motor housing restricting heat dissipation,
(3) elevated ambient temperature in pump room (28°C), (4) slightly elevated motor current 
suggesting increased mechanical load. No electrical faults detected. This represents normal 
wear requiring preventive maintenance rather than component failure.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Controlled shutdown during scheduled window (14:00)
2. Motor housing and ventilation cleaning (compressed air and vacuum)
3. Cooling fan replacement
4. Motor bearing lubrication
5. Thermal protection relay verification
6. Ambient temperature assessment and ventilation improvement
7. Motor current analysis and load verification
8. 3-hour operational test with thermal monitoring

PARTS REPLACED:
- Motor cooling fan assembly (Part #: AF3000-FAN-001)
- Fan mounting hardware (Part #: AF3000-FAN-MNT)
- Thermal protection relay (recalibrated, not replaced)

CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE:
- Motor housing cleaned (removed 2.3 lbs of dust/debris)
- Ventilation ports cleared
- Electrical connections inspected and tightened
- Motor mounting bolts torque-verified
- Pump room ventilation filters replaced

POST-SERVICE VERIFICATION:
- Motor temperature: 72°C at full load (NORMAL - 26% improvement)
- Cooling fan airflow: 285 CFM (NORMAL - meets specification)
- Motor current: 98% nominal (NORMAL)
- Vibration RMS: 2.4 mm/s (NORMAL)
- Flow rate: 48.3 L/s (NORMAL)
- Pressure: 122.7 psi (NORMAL)
- Thermal imaging shows uniform cooling

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement quarterly motor cleaning schedule (currently annual)
- Install permanent motor temperature monitoring with trending
- Improve pump room ventilation (recommend additional exhaust fan)
- Schedule cooling fan replacement every 2 years (preventive)
- Add motor temperature to predictive maintenance dashboard
- Consider installing air filtration in pump room to reduce dust

PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM ENHANCEMENT:
- Add motor cooling system inspection to monthly checklist
- Implement temperature trending alerts (>2°C increase/month)
- Create standard cleaning procedure for all AquaFlow-3000 units
- Train facility staff on early warning signs
- Update maintenance schedule based on environmental conditions

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT:
- Pump room ambient temperature: 28°C (recommend <25°C)
- Humidity: 65% (acceptable range)
- Dust level: elevated (recommend air filtration)
- Ventilation: marginal (recommend improvement)

Total Service Time: 4.5 hours
Next Scheduled Maintenance: 2024-12-18
Warranty Status: UNDER WARRANTY (Expires 2025-09-20)
