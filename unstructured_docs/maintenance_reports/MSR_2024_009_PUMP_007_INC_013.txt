MAINTENANCE SERVICE REPORT
===========================
Report ID: MSR-2024-009
Pump ID: PUMP_007
Incident ID: INC_013
Service Date: 2024-06-15
Technician: Maria Rodriguez
Service Type: Motor Replacement - Emergency

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Motor overheat condition escalated to motor failure in PUMP_007 (HydroMax-5000) at coordinates 
40.7282,-74.0776. High patient impact classification due to critical service area. Complete 
motor replacement required.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
- Motor temperature reached 142°C (critical threshold: 125°C)
- Motor winding insulation resistance below acceptable levels (0.3 MΩ)
- Abnormal motor current signature indicating winding damage
- Thermal imaging revealed hot spots in stator windings
- Vibration increased to 4.0 mm/s
- Fault Codes FC_002 and FC_012 triggered
- Previous incident (INC_005) showed early warning signs

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Motor failure attributed to progressive winding insulation breakdown over 1,023 service days.
Contributing factors include: (1) inadequate cooling due to partially blocked ventilation ports,
(2) elevated ambient temperature in pump room (32°C vs. design 25°C), (3) voltage imbalance 
detected in facility power supply (3.2% phase-to-phase variation). Previous flow degradation 
incident may have increased motor load.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Emergency shutdown and lockout/tagout at 10:15
2. Complete motor removal and replacement
3. Motor mounting alignment verification
4. Electrical connections inspection and upgrade
5. Ventilation system cleaning and optimization
6. Power quality analysis and correction
7. Thermal protection relay calibration
8. 6-hour commissioning test with thermal monitoring

PARTS REPLACED:
- Complete motor assembly (Part #: HM5000-MOTOR-15HP)
- Motor mounting hardware (Part #: HM5000-MNT-KIT)
- Thermal protection relay (Part #: TPR-150A-3PH)
- Motor cooling fan (Part #: HM5000-FAN-001)
- Power cable connectors (Part #: PWR-CONN-15HP)

POST-SERVICE VERIFICATION:
- Motor temperature: 68°C at full load (NORMAL)
- Winding insulation resistance: 125 MΩ (EXCELLENT)
- Motor current: balanced within 1.2% across phases (EXCELLENT)
- Vibration RMS: 2.2 mm/s (NORMAL)
- Flow rate: 46.8 L/s (NORMAL)
- Thermal imaging shows uniform temperature distribution

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Install permanent motor temperature monitoring system
- Upgrade pump room HVAC to maintain 25°C maximum ambient
- Implement quarterly power quality monitoring
- Schedule motor winding insulation testing annually
- Consider installing variable frequency drive (VFD) to reduce thermal stress
- Clean ventilation ports monthly instead of quarterly

FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
- Pump room ventilation upgraded (3 additional exhaust fans installed)
- Power quality monitoring system installed
- Ambient temperature alarm system added
- Emergency backup pump activation procedure updated

Total Service Time: 9.5 hours
Next Scheduled Maintenance: 2024-09-15
Warranty Status: UNDER WARRANTY (Motor: 2-year warranty from installation)
