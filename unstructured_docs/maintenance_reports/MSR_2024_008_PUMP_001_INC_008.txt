MAINTENANCE SERVICE REPORT
===========================
Report ID: MSR-2024-008
Pump ID: PUMP_001
Incident ID: INC_008
Service Date: 2024-04-10
Technician: David Kim
Service Type: Sensor Replacement

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Chlorine sensor malfunction detected in PUMP_001 (AquaFlow-3000) at coordinates 40.7128,-74.0060.
Low patient impact - routine sensor replacement performed during scheduled maintenance window.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
- Chlorine sensor readings erratic (fluctuating between 0.8-3.5 ppm)
- Sensor response time degraded (>45 seconds vs. normal 10 seconds)
- Calibration attempts unsuccessful
- All other pump parameters within normal range
- Fault Code FC_008 triggered: Chlorine Sensor Malfunction
- Sensor age: 892 days (recommended replacement: 730 days)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Normal sensor degradation due to extended service life. Chlorine sensors typically experience 
electrode fouling and membrane degradation after 24 months of continuous operation. No evidence 
of external damage or contamination. Preventive replacement overdue by approximately 5 months.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Temporary bypass of chlorine monitoring with manual testing protocol
2. Sensor removal and inspection
3. New sensor installation with calibration
4. Verification against laboratory-grade reference meter
5. Data logging system updated with new sensor parameters
6. 2-hour operational verification

PARTS REPLACED:
- Chlorine sensor assembly (Part #: AF3000-CL-SENS-001)
- Sensor mounting gasket (Part #: AF3000-GSKT-002)
- Calibration solution kit (Part #: CAL-KIT-CL-STD)

POST-SERVICE VERIFICATION:
- Chlorine reading: 2.1 ppm (matches reference meter)
- Sensor response time: 8 seconds (EXCELLENT)
- Vibration RMS: 2.3 mm/s (NORMAL)
- Flow rate: 45.2 L/s (NORMAL)
- Pressure: 120.5 psi (NORMAL)
- All systems operational

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Implement automated sensor replacement alerts at 700 service days
- Consider upgrading to smart sensors with self-diagnostic capabilities
- Schedule next chlorine sensor replacement for 2026-04-10
- Add quarterly sensor calibration verification to maintenance schedule

WATER QUALITY COMPLIANCE:
- EPA Safe Drinking Water Act compliance maintained
- Chlorine residual levels within 0.2-4.0 ppm specification
- No water quality incidents during sensor malfunction period
- Continuous manual monitoring logs reviewed and approved

Total Service Time: 2.5 hours
Next Scheduled Maintenance: 2024-07-10
Warranty Status: UNDER WARRANTY (Expires 2025-06-30)
