MAINTENANCE SERVICE REPORT
===========================
Report ID: MSR-2024-002
Pump ID: PUMP_009
Incident ID: INC_002
Service Date: 2024-01-22
Technician: Sarah Chen
Service Type: Scheduled Repair

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Seal leak detected in PUMP_009 (HydroMax-5000) during routine inspection. Medium patient impact 
classification. Service performed during scheduled maintenance window.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
- Visual inspection revealed moisture around primary seal
- Pressure drop of 3.2 PSI observed over 24-hour period
- Chlorine level inconsistency in downstream monitoring
- Fault Code FC_006 logged: Seal Leak Detected
- No abnormal vibration patterns detected

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Primary seal degradation due to extended service life (1,567 days). Material analysis showed 
chemical compatibility stress from chlorine exposure over time. Seal hardness testing indicated 
25% degradation from specification.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Controlled shutdown initiated
2. Primary seal assembly removal and inspection
3. Seal housing surface preparation and cleaning
4. Installation of upgraded seal design (improved chlorine resistance)
5. Pressure testing to 150% operating pressure
6. 2-hour operational verification

PARTS REPLACED:
- Primary mechanical seal assembly (Part #: HM5000-SEAL-002-UPG)
- O-ring set (Part #: HM5000-ORING-KIT)
- Seal flush line filter (Part #: HM5000-FLUSH-FLT)

POST-SERVICE VERIFICATION:
- Zero leakage detected during 2-hour test
- Pressure stability maintained (105.6 PSI ±0.5)
- Flow rate: 34.2 L/s (within normal operating range for this unit)
- Chlorine level stable at 1.6 PPM

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Monitor seal performance weekly for 60 days
- Consider upgrading all HydroMax-5000 units to improved seal design
- Implement seal flush system pressure monitoring for early detection
- Schedule seal replacement at 1,200 days service age going forward

Total Service Time: 3.5 hours
Next Scheduled Maintenance: 2024-04-22
Warranty Status: OUT OF WARRANTY (Expired 2024-08-20)
