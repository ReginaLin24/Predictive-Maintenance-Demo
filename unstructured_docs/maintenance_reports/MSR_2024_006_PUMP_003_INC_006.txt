MAINTENANCE SERVICE REPORT
===========================
Report ID: MSR-2024-006
Pump ID: PUMP_003
Incident ID: INC_006
Service Date: 2024-03-14
Technician: Robert Kim
Service Type: Emergency Repair

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Pressure drop incident on PUMP_003 (HydroMax-5000) following recent bearing replacement. 
High patient impact classification. This is the second incident on this unit within 90 days.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
- Discharge pressure dropped from 110.2 PSI to 92.5 PSI over 6-hour period
- Fault Code FC_015: Pipe Pressure Drop
- Flow rate maintained but with increased power consumption (+12%)
- No abnormal vibration detected (2.8 mm/s)
- Downstream pressure sensors showing consistent low readings
- Recent service history: Bearing replacement on 2024-01-15 (MSR-2024-001)

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Investigation revealed internal wear ring clearance increase beyond specification. Post-failure 
analysis indicates:
1. Accelerated wear due to abrasive particles in fluid (sediment content high)
2. Inadequate flushing after bearing service allowed debris accumulation
3. Wear ring clearance measured at 0.85mm (specification: 0.25-0.40mm)
4. Internal recirculation losses estimated at 15% of rated flow

Contributing factors: High service age (1,245 days) and operation in challenging water quality conditions.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Emergency shutdown coordinated with backup systems
2. Complete pump disassembly and internal inspection
3. Wear ring replacement (both suction and discharge sides)
4. Internal passage cleaning and flushing
5. Mechanical seal inspection (found acceptable, not replaced)
6. Reassembly with proper clearance verification
7. System flushing protocol prior to restart
8. 3-hour operational test with performance monitoring

PARTS REPLACED:
- Suction-side wear ring (Part #: HM5000-WR-SUCT)
- Discharge-side wear ring (Part #: HM5000-WR-DISCH)
- Internal gasket set (Part #: HM5000-GSKT-KIT)
- Wear ring mounting hardware (Part #: HM5000-HDW-WR)

POST-SERVICE VERIFICATION:
- Discharge pressure: 110.8 PSI (EXCELLENT, restored to specification)
- Flow rate: 38.9 L/s at rated head (NORMAL)
- Power consumption: returned to nominal values
- Wear ring clearances verified: 0.28mm suction, 0.32mm discharge (WITHIN SPEC)
- Internal recirculation losses: <2% (EXCELLENT)
- Efficiency: 81% (improved from 68%)

PERFORMANCE COMPARISON:
                    Before Service    After Service    Specification
Pressure (PSI):     92.5             110.8            108-115
Efficiency (%):     68               81               78-84
Power (kW):         22.4             20.1             19.5-21.0

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Install water quality monitoring (turbidity and sediment)
- Implement pre-filtration system for high-sediment sources
- Reduce wear ring replacement interval to 800 days for this location
- Consider upgraded wear ring material (silicon carbide vs. bronze)
- Add internal clearance monitoring to predictive maintenance program
- Perform post-service system flushing protocol on all future repairs
- Quarterly performance testing for next 12 months

INCIDENT PATTERN ANALYSIS:
This unit (PUMP_003) has experienced 2 incidents in 90 days:
- INC_001 (2024-01-15): Bearing failure
- INC_006 (2024-03-14): Wear ring failure
Recommend comprehensive reliability improvement program for this asset.
