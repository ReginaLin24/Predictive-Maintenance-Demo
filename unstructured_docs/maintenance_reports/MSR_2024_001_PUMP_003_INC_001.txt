MAINTENANCE SERVICE REPORT
===========================
Report ID: MSR-2024-001
Pump ID: PUMP_003
Incident ID: INC_001
Service Date: 2024-01-15
Technician: James Martinez
Service Type: Emergency Repair

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Critical bearing failure detected in PUMP_003 (HydroMax-5000) located at coordinates 40.7580,-73.9855. 
Emergency response initiated due to high patient impact classification.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
- Excessive vibration detected (RMS reading: 5.6 mm/s)
- Bearing temperature exceeded 85°C threshold
- Abnormal noise patterns during operation
- Flow rate degraded to 35.8 L/s (normal range: 45-55 L/s)
- Fault Code FC_005 triggered: Bearing Temperature High

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Primary cause identified as bearing wear due to extended service period (1,245 days).
Lubrication system showed signs of degradation. Secondary contributing factor: excessive vibration 
over past 72 hours preceding failure.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Emergency shutdown executed at 14:23
2. Complete bearing assembly replacement
3. Lubrication system flush and refill
4. Vibration sensor recalibration
5. Motor alignment verification
6. 4-hour operational test completed successfully

PARTS REPLACED:
- Main bearing assembly (Part #: HM5000-BRG-001)
- Lubrication filter (Part #: HM5000-LUB-FLT)
- Bearing temperature sensor (Part #: TEMP-SENS-K-TYPE)

POST-SERVICE VERIFICATION:
- Vibration RMS: 2.1 mm/s (NORMAL)
- Flow rate: 48.5 L/s (NORMAL)
- Bearing temperature: 52°C (NORMAL)
- All sensor readings within specification

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Increase monitoring frequency to weekly for next 30 days
- Schedule preventive bearing replacement at 1,100 service days for similar units
- Implement predictive maintenance algorithm for early bearing wear detection

Total Service Time: 6.5 hours
Next Scheduled Maintenance: 2024-04-15
Warranty Status: OUT OF WARRANTY (Expired 2024-12-31)
