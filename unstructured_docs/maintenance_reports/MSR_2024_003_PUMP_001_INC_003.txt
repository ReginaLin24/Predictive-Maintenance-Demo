MAINTENANCE SERVICE REPORT
===========================
Report ID: MSR-2024-003
Pump ID: PUMP_001
Incident ID: INC_003
Service Date: 2024-02-05
Technician: Michael Thompson
Service Type: Preventive Maintenance

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Vibration alarm triggered on PUMP_001 (AquaFlow-3000) during automated monitoring. Low patient 
impact classification. Proactive service performed to prevent escalation.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
- Vibration RMS reading elevated to 3.5 mm/s (threshold: 3.0 mm/s)
- No bearing temperature abnormalities detected
- Flow rate slightly reduced: 43.2 L/s (normal: 45-50 L/s)
- Pressure readings within specification: 117.8 PSI
- Fault Code FC_001: Excessive Vibration Detected

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Investigation revealed minor impeller imbalance caused by debris accumulation. Unit has 892 days 
service age with consistent operation in high-sediment water source. No structural damage detected. 
Bearing condition assessed as good with 40% remaining service life.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Scheduled shutdown coordinated with operations
2. Impeller inspection and cleaning
3. Removed mineral deposits and debris
4. Dynamic balancing verification
5. Vibration sensor calibration check
6. 1-hour operational test with monitoring

PARTS REPLACED:
- None (cleaning and calibration service only)

CONSUMABLES USED:
- Cleaning solution (Part #: CLN-SOL-001)
- Calibration reference standard

POST-SERVICE VERIFICATION:
- Vibration RMS: 2.2 mm/s (EXCELLENT)
- Flow rate restored: 45.8 L/s (NORMAL)
- Pressure: 120.1 PSI (NORMAL)
- Bearing temperature: 48°C (NORMAL)
- All operational parameters within specification

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Continue monthly vibration monitoring
- Install upstream filtration improvement to reduce debris
- Schedule impeller inspection every 6 months for high-sediment locations
- Consider preventive cleaning cycle every 180 days
- Bearing replacement recommended at 1,100 days service age

Total Service Time: 2.0 hours
Next Scheduled Maintenance: 2024-05-05
Warranty Status: UNDER WARRANTY (Expires 2025-06-30)
