MAINTENANCE SERVICE REPORT
===========================
Report ID: MSR-2024-010
Pump ID: PUMP_003
Incident ID: INC_014
Service Date: 2024-06-29
Technician: Robert Taylor
Service Type: Critical Seal Failure - Emergency

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
Critical seal leak in PUMP_003 (HydroMax-5000) at coordinates 40.7580,-73.9855. This is the 
third major incident for this unit (previous: INC_001, INC_006). Critical patient impact due 
to water contamination risk. Unit retirement under consideration.

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
- Major seal leak detected (estimated 5 gallons/hour)
- Visible water pooling around pump base
- Shaft wear detected during inspection (0.008" out of tolerance)
- Bearing contamination from water ingress
- Pressure fluctuations: 107.4-112.8 psi (unstable)
- Fault Code FC_006 triggered: Seal Leak Detected
- Service age: 1,245 days with 3 major failures

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Mechanical seal failure due to shaft wear and misalignment. Root cause investigation reveals:
(1) Shaft damage from previous bearing failure (INC_001) not fully addressed, (2) improper 
seal installation during previous repair (INC_006), (3) pump foundation settling causing 
misalignment, (4) unit operating beyond recommended service life for this application.
Metallurgical analysis of shaft shows fatigue cracking.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Immediate shutdown and containment at 06:32
2. Water cleanup and contamination assessment
3. Complete seal assembly replacement
4. Shaft sleeve installation to restore sealing surface
5. Pump foundation leveling and grouting
6. Alignment verification (laser alignment system)
7. Bearing inspection and replacement (preventive)
8. Piping stress analysis and support adjustment
9. 12-hour leak test and operational verification

PARTS REPLACED:
- Mechanical seal assembly (Part #: HM5000-SEAL-001)
- Shaft wear sleeve (Part #: HM5000-SHAFT-SLEEVE)
- Bearing set (Part #: HM5000-BRG-001)
- Seal chamber gaskets (Part #: HM5000-GSKT-SET)
- Foundation anchor bolts (Part #: ANCHOR-BOLT-M20)

POST-SERVICE VERIFICATION:
- Zero leakage detected (EXCELLENT)
- Shaft runout: 0.001" (EXCELLENT)
- Alignment: within 0.002" (EXCELLENT)
- Vibration RMS: 2.3 mm/s (NORMAL)
- Pressure: 119.5 psi stable (NORMAL)
- Flow rate: 47.2 L/s (NORMAL)
- 12-hour leak test: PASSED

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- **CRITICAL: Recommend unit retirement and replacement within 6 months**
- This unit has experienced 3 major failures in 6 months
- Cost of continued repairs approaching 70% of replacement cost
- Reliability concerns for critical healthcare application
- If continued operation necessary:
  * Weekly inspection for next 90 days
  * Install leak detection system with automatic shutdown
  * Maintain emergency backup pump on hot standby
  * Prepare detailed replacement specifications

RELIABILITY ANALYSIS:
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): 62 days (unacceptable)
- Cumulative maintenance cost: $18,450 (6 months)
- Estimated replacement cost: $26,000
- Availability: 94.2% (target: 99.5%)
- Risk assessment: HIGH - recommend replacement

FACILITY NOTIFICATION:
- Hospital engineering director notified of retirement recommendation
- Risk management department briefed
- Capital equipment request submitted
- Backup pump protocols enhanced

Total Service Time: 14.5 hours
Next Scheduled Maintenance: 2024-07-29 (WEEKLY INSPECTIONS)
Warranty Status: OUT OF WARRANTY (Expired 2024-12-31)
